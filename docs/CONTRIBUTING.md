Fill in [the template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps to resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [issues](https://github.com/sergiomartins8/test-automation-bootstrap/issues).
Fill in [the template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/enhancement.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### Your first code contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking for **utils** methods or classes you would like to see implemented:

* Database connections (e.g. MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
* File readers (e.g. Excel, PDF)

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain test-automation-bootstrap's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible test automation template ‚ú®
- Enable a sustainable system for maintaining and review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](../.github/pull_request_template.md)
1. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing 

<details>
<summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>
If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. 
If it's concluded that the failure was a false positive, then an issue will be opened to track that problem.
</details>


While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
